iNeedADollar,

Project done at the 8th Bootcamp at <Academia de Código_> in Fundão during a 24h Hackathon!

Hackathon's main theme was music, and the music selected for this group was "I Need a Dollar" from Aloe Blacc.

During a pretty quick BrainStorming we got to the decision that we wanted to develop an App that had in it's basis the 
pay it forward action

The App is based on helping people all over the globe that have the need for a dollar to pay anything. Why a Dollar? A dollar
is meaningless for most people, but can help someone in need.
It works based on the transfer of money from person to person, as long as they both have the App.
There is a concept of balancing of favours and some other really cool features.

Any questions? Read and enjoy the code, or just ask, we are chill people.

Project Developed by João Pedro, João Faustino, Tiago Gonçalves, Pedro Alves e João Fazenda.
