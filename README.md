Hackathon's theme was music and inspired by Aloe's Blacc _I Need A Dollar_ we started developing a concept.

During a pretty quick brainstorming we got to the decision that we wanted to develop an App based on a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6dzp1p/i_just_bought_my_younger_brother_a_beer_in_korea/) and the [Pay It Forward](https://payitforwardday.com/about/how-does-it-work/) concept.

The App basis is on helping people all over the world that have the need for a dollar to pay anything. Why a **Dollar**?
A dollar is meaningless for most people, but can help someone in need.
It works based on a transfer of money from person to person, as long as they both have are part of the **community**!
